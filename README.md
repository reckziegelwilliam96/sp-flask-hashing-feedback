# sp-flask-hashing-feedback

In this exercise, we’ll be creating an application that lets users sign up and log in to their own accounts. Once logged in, users can add feedback, edit their feedback, delete their feedback, and see a list of all feedback that they’ve given. Many of these routes should be protected, so that for example user1 can’t edit a piece of feedback that user2 created. (More on this below.)

Part 0: Set up your environment
You know the drill. Make a venv, pip install all the things, put your code on GitHub, etc.

Part 1: Create User Model
First, create a User model for SQLAlchemy. Put this in a models.py file.

It should have the following columns:

username - a unique primary key that is no longer than 20 characters.
password - a not-nullable column that is text
email - a not-nullable column that is unique and no longer than 50 characters.
first_name - a not-nullable column that is no longer than 30 characters.
last_name - a not-nullable column that is no longer than 30 characters.
Part 2: Make a Base Template
Add a base template with slots for the page title and content. Your other templates should use this.

You can use Bootstrap for this project, but don’t spend a lot of time worrying about styling — this is not a goal of this exercise.

Part 3: Make Routes For Users
Make routes for the following:

GET /
Redirect to /register.
GET /register
Show a form that when submitted will register/create a user. This form should accept a username, password, email, first_name, and last_name.

Make sure you are using WTForms and that your password input hides the characters that the user is typing!

POST /register
Process the registration form by adding a new user. Then redirect to /secret
GET /login
Show a form that when submitted will login a user. This form should accept a username and a password.

Make sure you are using WTForms and that your password input hides the characters that the user is typing!

POST /login
Process the login form, ensuring the user is authenticated and going to /secret if so.
GET /secret
Return the text “You made it!” (don’t worry, we’ll get rid of this soon)
Part 4: Don’t let everyone go to /secret
Despite all of this wonderful password hashing that you have been doing, anyone can navigate to /secret and see the text “You made it!”. Let’s protect this route and make sure that only users who have logged in can access this route!

To do that, we’re going to make sure that when we log a user in (and after they register), we store just a little information in the session. When the user successfully registers or logs in, store the username in the session.

Part 5: Log out users
Make routes for the following:

GET /logout
Clear any information from the session and redirect to /
Part 6: Let’s change /secret to /users/<username>
Now that we have some logging in and and logging out working. Let’s add some authorization! When a user logs in, take them to the following route:

GET /users/<username>
Display a template the shows information about that user (everything except for their password)

You should ensure that only logged in users can access this page.

Part 7: Give us some more feedback!
It’s time to add another model.

Create a Feedback model for SQLAlchemy. Put this in a models.py file.

It should have the following columns:

id - a unique primary key that is an auto incrementing integer
title - a not-nullable column that is at most 100 characters
content - a not-nullable column that is text
username - a foreign key that references the username column in the users table
Part 8: Make/Modify Routes For Users and Feedback
GET /users/<username>
Show information about the given user.

Show all of the feedback that the user has given.

For each piece of feedback, display with a link to a form to edit the feedback and a button to delete the feedback.

Have a link that sends you to a form to add more feedback and a button to delete the user Make sure that only the user who is logged in can successfully view this page.

POST /users/<username>/delete
Remove the user from the database and make sure to also delete all of their feedback. Clear any user information in the session and redirect to /. Make sure that only the user who is logged in can successfully delete their account
GET /users/<username>/feedback/add
Display a form to add feedback Make sure that only the user who is logged in can see this form
POST /users/<username>/feedback/add
Add a new piece of feedback and redirect to /users/<username> — Make sure that only the user who is logged in can successfully add feedback
GET /feedback/<feedback-id>/update
Display a form to edit feedback — **Make sure that only the user who has written that feedback can see this form **
POST /feedback/<feedback-id>/update
Update a specific piece of feedback and redirect to /users/<username> — Make sure that only the user who has written that feedback can update it
POST /feedback/<feedback-id>/delete
Delete a specific piece of feedback and redirect to /users/<username> — Make sure that only the user who has written that feedback can delete it
